## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration

The dataset was initially explored to understand:

- Dataset structure
- Data types
- Missing values
- Duplicate records
- Unique categories
- Statistical summaries

---

### 2. Data Cleaning

The following cleaning activities were performed:

- Checked for missing values.
- Identified and removed duplicate records.
- Converted restaurant ratings into numerical format.
- Reset the DataFrame index.
- Checked categorical columns for inconsistent or unexpected values.

After cleaning, the dataset contained **780 unique records**.

### 3. Feature Engineering

Three new features were created to make the analysis more meaningful.

#### Rating Category

Ratings were classified into:

- Low
- Average
- High

#### Cost Category

Restaurants were grouped into:

- Budget
- Moderate
- Expensive

#### Engagement Category

Restaurants were classified based on their number of votes:

- Low
- Medium
- High

---

## 📊 Business Analysis

The project answers several important business questions, including:

- Which restaurant type is most common?
- Which restaurant type has the highest average rating?
- Does online ordering relate to restaurant ratings?
- Does table booking relate to restaurant ratings?
- How does restaurant cost relate to ratings?
- Which restaurants receive higher customer engagement?
- What is the relationship between votes and ratings?

---

## 📈 Visualizations

The following visualizations were created:

### 1. Distribution of Restaurant Types

Shows the number of restaurants belonging to each restaurant category.

### 2. Average Rating by Restaurant Type

Compares the average customer rating across restaurant types.

### 3. Average Rating by Online Order Availability

Compares ratings between restaurants with and without online ordering.

### 4. Average Rating by Table Booking Availability

Compares ratings between restaurants with and without table booking.

### 5. Average Rating by Cost Category

Analyzes the relationship between restaurant pricing and average ratings.

### 6. Relationship Between Votes and Ratings

A scatter plot was used to examine the relationship between customer votes and restaurant ratings.
