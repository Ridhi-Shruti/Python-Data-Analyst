### 📂 Dataset

| Dataset | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Customers** | Demographics, age, state, gender, acquisition channel |
| **Orders** | Order dates, sales amount, delivery, status, channel |
| **Order Items** | Product-level quantity and price per order |
| **Products** | Category, brand, skin type, launch date |
| **Returns** | Return reason, date, refund status |
| **Reviews** | Ratings (1-5) and review text |

### 🔄 Workflow

**1. Data Exploration**
Checked shape, info, dtypes, missing values, duplicates, descriptive stats for all 6 datasets.

**2. Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Converted all date columns to datetime with `dayfirst=True`
- Handled missing `delivered_date` for pending/cancelled orders
- Standardized text columns

**3. Feature Engineering**
Created: `order_year`, `order_month`, `year_month`, `delivery_days`, `delivery_status`, `age_group`

**4. Data Merging**
Built 4 analysis-ready dataframes:
- `sales_df` = Orders + Order_Items + Customers
- `customer_product_df` = sales_df + Products
- `returns_analysis_df` = Returns + Orders + Products
- `reviews_analysis_df` = Reviews + Products
